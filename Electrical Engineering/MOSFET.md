## 1 Semiconductors
Silicon is the 14th element and the atoms have 4 electrons on the outer layer. Silicon atom will form 4 covalent bonds with other silicon atoms and not extra electrons left so pure silicon has weak conductivity. 

Phosphorus (P) is the 15th element and the atoms have 5 electrons on the outer layer.  If we replace some of the silicon atoms with phosphorus atoms, there will be extra electrons left after 4 covalent bonds are formed between the atoms. This increases the inductivity negatively so it is called the N-type (negative) semiconductor. 

Boron (B) is the 5th element and the atoms have 3 electrons on the outer layer. Replacing silicon atoms with boron atoms will result in a hole where a electron can fit in. This increases the inductivity positively so it is called the P-type (positive) semiconductor. 

## 2 P-N junction diode
P -> N: current can pass through
N -> P: current cannot pass through

## 3 MOSFET
MOSFET is the abbreviation for metal-oxide-semiconductor field-electric-transistor. 
MOS has Source (S), Drain (D), and Gate(G). 
   
NMOS: high voltage can pass
Arrow points out from source
PMOS: low voltage can pass
Arrow points into source
