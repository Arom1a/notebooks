### 1.1 Alpha decay
The alpha particle is the nucleus of a Helium atom, consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. 

### 1.2 Beta decay
The beta particle is either a electron or a positron, consist of only high. 
Positron is the antimatter version of electron. It has positive charge but positive mass. In fact, every antimatter has positive mass.

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}} = \sqrt{\frac{3k_BT}{m}}$$, where $M$ is the molar mass, $m$ is the mass of the total gas, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant ($k_B = \pu{1.38 \cdot 10^{-23} J/K}$).
