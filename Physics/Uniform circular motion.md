## 1 Basic formulas
$$v=r\omega=\frac{2\pi r}{T}$$
$$\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}=2\pi f$$
$$a_c=\frac{v^2}{r}=\omega^2r=\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2}r=\omega v$$
$$F_c=m\times a_c$$

## 2 Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion
### 2.1 Kepler's 1st law
Planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun as a focus.

### 2.2 Kepler's 2nd law
A line running from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas of the ellipse in equal times.

### 2.3 Kepler's 3rd law
$$\frac{{a_1}^3}{{T_1}^2}=\frac{{a_2}^3}{{T_2}^2}=k$$, where $a$ is the length of the orbit's semi-major axis, $T$ is the orbit period.

## 3 Cosmic Velocity (on the Earth's surface)
### 3.1 1st cosmic velocity:
The first cosmic velocity is known as the orbital velocity, which is the least velocity of a projectile to keep the orbit around a celestial body.
> When the centripetal and gravitational forces are in equilibrium, the object can hold the orbit. Let’s consider the Earth’s surface.
> $m\cdot \frac{v^2}{r}=G\cdot \frac{mM}{r^2}$
> So, $v_1=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}=7.91\times 10^3\,m/s$,&ensp;&ensp;where $M$ is the mass of the Earth, $5.792\times 10^{24}\,kg$, $r$ is the Earth's radius, $6371\,km$
### 3.2 2nd cosmic velocity:
The second cosmic velocity is known as the escape velocity. This is the velocity that escapes from the gravitational field of a celestial body.
> This will be obtained by the energy conservation.
> $\frac{1}{2}m{v_2}^2-G\cdot \frac{mM}{r}=0$
> So, $v_2=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}=11.2\times 10^3\,m/s$
### 3.3 3rd cosmic velocity:
The third cosmic velocity is the velocity that can escape from the gravitational field of the solar system.
> Consider the orbit of the Earth around the Sun and this radius is $r_o=1.5\times 10^{11}$. The velocity is calculated from the energy conservation with the gravity of the Sun.
> $\frac{1}{2}M{v_s}^2-G\cdot \frac{MM_s}{r_o}=0$
> So, $v_s=\sqrt{\frac{2GM_s}{r_o}}=42.1\times 10^3\,m/s$, where $M_s$ is the mass of the Sun, $1.99\times 10^{30}\,kg$
> This is the velocity from the reference frame of the Sun; therefore, we have to subtract the orbital velocity from the above velocity. Earth’s orbital velocity can be obtained from the centripetal force and gravitational force from the Sun.
> $M\cdot \frac{{v_e}^2}{r_o}=G\cdot \frac{MM_s}{{r_o}^2}$
> So, $v_e=\sqrt{\frac{GM_s}{r_o}}=29.8\times 10^3\,m/s$
> Thus, the escape velocity from the orbit is
> $v_o=v_s-v_e=12.3\times 10^3\,m/s$
> Now, consider the celocity from the surface of the Earth, which becomes the third cosmic velocity.
> $\frac{1}{2}m{v_3}^2-G\cdot \frac{mM}{r}=\frac{1}{2}m{v_o}^2$
> So, $v_3=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}+{v_o}^2}=16.7\times 10^3\,m/s$
