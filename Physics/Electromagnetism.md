Electric flux: $$\phi = E \cdot S = ES\cos{\theta}$$where $E$ is the magnitude of a uniform electric field, $S$ is the area of the plane, $\theta$ is the angle between them. 

## 1 Gauss's Law of Electricity
$$E\,dA = \frac{\sum{q}}{\epsilon_0}$$

## 2 Gauss's law of Magnetism
$$B\,d{A} = 0$$

## 3 Ampere's Circuital Law (Motor's Law)
$$\int{B\cdot dl} = \mu_0I$$

## 4 Faraday's Law of Induction
$$\epsilon = -N\frac{\Delta{\Phi}}{\Delta{t}}$$

## 5 Biot-Savart Law
$$B = \frac{\mu_0NI}{2R}$$ 

## 6 Hand Rules
### 6.1 Right Spiral Hand Rule
(Used for ***generating magnetic field***)

### 6.2 Right Hand Rule
(Used for ***generating electricity***)
%% 
$B$ through palm
Thumb towards the direction of $v$
$I$ is then in the direction of the fingers
%%

### 6.3 Left Hand Rule
Also called motor rule, since it is used to determine the direction of Ampere's force and Lorentz's force. 
(Used for ***consuming electricity***)
%%
$B$ through palm
Fingers towards $I$
$F$ is then in the direction of the fingers
%%

## 7 Magnetism
Magnetic flux: $$\phi=B\cdot S=BS\cos{\theta}$$where $B$ is the magnitude of a uniform magnetic field, $S$ is the area of the plane, $\theta$ is the angle between them

Ampere's force: $$F=IBL*\sin{\theta}$$where $\theta$ is the angle between $B$ and $I$

Lorentz force: $$F=qBv*\sin{\theta}$$where $\theta$ is the angle between $B$ and $v$

$$E = Blv$$
