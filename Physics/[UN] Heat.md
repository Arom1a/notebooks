## 1 Thermal Conduction
$$\frac{dQ}{dt} = \frac{kA\Delta{T}}{l}$$, where $k$ is the thermal conductivity constant for the material, $A$ is the cross-section area, $\Delta{T}$ is the difference of temperature, $l$ is the length of the wall. 

## 2 Stefanâ€“Boltzmann law
$$\frac{dQ}{dt} = e\sigma AT^4$$, where $e$ is the emissivity (1 for black bodies, 0 for white bodies, and gray bodies in-between), $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant ($\pu{5.67 \times 10^{-8} W\cdot m^{-2}\cdot K^{-4}}$).
