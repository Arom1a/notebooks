$$\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u}+\frac{1}{v}$$where $f$ is the focal length, $u$ is the object's distance from the lens, and $v$ is the images's distance form the lens. 

## 2 Lens
![[lens.png | 400]]
### 2.1 Convex lens (or converging lens)
$< f$: unreal image, magnify, same side
$f< \text{and} < 2f$: real image, magnify, opposite side
$> 2f$: real image, reduce, opposite side

### 2.2 Concave lens (or diverging lens)

## 3 Mirror
![[mirror.webp | 400]]
### 3.1 Concave mirror
has the same properties as convex lens

### 3.2 Convex mirror
has the same properties as concave lens
