$$W = hf_0$$, where $W$ is the work function, $h$ is the Plunk constant, $f_0$ is the threshold frequency. 

$$c = \lambda f$$, where $c$ is the speed of light, $\lambda$ is the wave length, $f$ is the frequency. 

$$E_k = E_{photon} - E_0 = hf - hf_0 = \frac{hf}{\lambda} - E_0$$

$\pu{1 eV} = \pu{1.6\times 10^{-19} J}$
