## 1 Electric Force
$$F = k\cdot\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$$

## 2 Electric Field (Strength)
### 2.1 Electric Field Lines
It is a visualized tool to see the electric field clearly, which is introduced by Michael Faraday (English). 
1. $\overrightarrow{E}$ is tangent to the field lines
2. Denser the lines are, stronger the field is
3. Electric field lines ever cross
4. The lines points from positive charges to negative charges
### 2.2 Point charge
$$E = k\cdot\frac{Q}{r^2}$$
### 2.3 Uniformly charged sphere
It is equivalent to a point charge at the center of the sphere. So, also: 
$$E = k\cdot\frac{Q}{r^2}$$
### 2.4 Discrete charges
$$\overrightarrow{E} = \sum{\overrightarrow{E_i}}$$
### 2.5 Continuous charges
Use calculus to analyze the problems. 
Volume charge density: $\rho = \frac{Q}{V}$
Surface charge density: $\sigma = \frac{Q}{A}$
Linear charge density: $\lambda = \frac{Q}{l}$
### 2.6 The connection between Electric Forces and Electric Field (Strength)
$$\overrightarrow{E} = \frac{\overrightarrow{F}}{q}$$

## 3 Electric Potential Energy
### 3.1 Electric Potential Energy Difference
The potential difference energy from A to B is equal to the negative of work done by electric force when moving the unit positive charge from point A to point B. 
$$U_{AB} = U_B-U_A = -\int_A^B{\vec{F}\,d\vec{r}}$$

### 3.2 Electric Potential Drops
Electric potential drops along the field lines. 

### 3.3 Equipotentials
The equipotentials are obtained by connecting all points at same potential. 
Potential difference between two successive equipotential is constant and the electric field line is always perpendicular to the equipotentials. 

## 4 Electric Potential
### 4.1 Definition
$$\Delta{V}_{AB} = V_B-V_A = -\int_A^B{E\cdot d\,r}$$

### 4.2 Due to Point Charge
$$V = k\frac{Q}{r}$$

### 4.3 The connection between Electric Potential Energy and Electric Potential Difference
$$\Delta{V} = \frac{\Delta{U}}{q}$$

## 5 Electric Force
Coulomb's law: $$F = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$$where $k$ is the coulomb constant, $9\times 10^9\text{N}\cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}^2$. 
$k$ is also equals to $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$ where $\epsilon_0$ is vacuum permittivity, $8.85\times 10^{-12}\text{C}^2/N\cdot \text{m}^2$.
