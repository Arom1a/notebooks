## 1 Light Redirection
### 1.1 Reflection
Angle of Incidence = Angle of Reflection

### 1.2 Refraction
#### 1.2.1 Index of refraction
$$n = \frac{c}{v}$$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, $v$ is the speed of light in the medium. 

### 1.3 Snell's law
$$n_1\times \lambda_1=n_2\times \lambda_2$$
$$n_1\times \sin{\theta_1}=n_2\times \sin{\theta_2}$$
$$n_1\times v_1=n_2\times v_2$$

### 1.4 Diffraction
$$m\lambda =d\sin{\theta}$$
$$y_m=\frac{m\lambda L}{d}$$

## 2 Primary Colors of Light
RGB (red green blue) is the model for light and CMYK (cyan magenta yellow key) is the model for pigment. 
![[primary_colors.webp | 600]]
Notice that the combination of cyan, magenta, and yellow can form red, green, and blue. 
## 3 Formation of Light
### 3.1 Fluorescence
The visible or invisible radiation that is emitted by certain substances that **have absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation**. 

### 3.2 Incandescence
Incandescence is the emission of electromagnetic radiation from a **hot body** as a result of its **high temperature**. 

### 3.3 Iridescence
Iridescence is the phenomenon of certain surfaces that appear gradually to change color as the **angle of view or the angle of illumination changes.** 

### 3.4 De-excitation
An electron in an atom can be **moved to a lower energy orbit** when the atom **emits an amount of energy** that exactly equals the energy difference between the orbits.
