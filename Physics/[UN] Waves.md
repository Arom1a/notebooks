## 1 General Property
$$v = \lambda\cdot f$$, where $v$ is the speed of the wave, $\lambda$ is the wavelength, $f$ is the frequency of the wave. 

## 2 Doppler Effect
$$f_r = f_s \cdot \frac{v \pm v_r}{v \mp v_s}$$, where $_r$ means the property of the receiver's, $_s$ means the property of the source's, $v$ is the speed of the wave. When the source is coming closer to the receiver, the frequency is increased, so it's $+$ at the top and $-$ at the bottom, and vice versa.

The red shift is an example of doppler effect. 

## 3 Standing Wave
The speed of the standing wave: $$v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{m/L}}$$, where $T$ is the tension on the rope, $m/L$ is the mass per unit length of the rope. 

## 4 Sound Wave
Intensity: 
$$I = \frac{P}{\text{Area}} = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$$

Sound level (decibel, dB): $$10\log{\frac{I}{I_0}}$$, where $I_0$ is the reference intensity ($I_0 = \pu{10^{-12}W/M^2}$)
