## 1 City of Stars
City of stars, are you shining just for me?
City of stars, there's so much that I can't see
Who knows? I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you
That now our dreams, they finally come true

City of stars, just one thing everybody wants
There in the bars and thought the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
It's love
Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else
A rush, a glance, a touch, a dance

A look in somebody's eyes
To light up the skies
To open the world and send it reeling
A voice that says, I'll be here
And you'll be alright
I don't care if I know
Just where I will go
'Cause all that I need is the crazy feeling
A rat-tat-tat on my heart...
Think I want it to stay

City of stars, are you shining just for me?
City of stars, you never shined so brightly
