Lone, unknown, I'm moving on through the night seams
I can view and espy, on a train wavering
Flowing on, and moving back backwards was a scenery
And so lonely, I watched it as I sat
As I sat

The early afternoon sun in the sky up above is stained by an orange hue
And I sat eyes on the growing indigo, it's crushing the sunset view
I kept track of the final light that I pursued
My eyes chased it as if I were lamenting
Today's bye-bye, that is why
