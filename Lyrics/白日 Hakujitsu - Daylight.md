## Daylight

At times you can't
Know what you've done till
You've wounded someone
Even if you don't know
The wrong at the time
On losing someone
You'll see it to be
You'll see the wrong
Hit you down

We can't go back
To what we used to be
Even if it shone
Too bright to be the truth
We gotta go on
To see another dawn
Even through the cold stormy snow

In the way I am today
What can I do anyway
What can I be anyway
If I'm gonna live for
Somebody else
I know I can't keep with the correct rules
To be yours
If I could see you again
In some city don't know where
Would you remember my name
Would you still know who I am
I guess by then we'll walk it through
The Spring'll melt into the air

Too late even if I started over
Won't matter even if I wipe it all out
It'll always cling to me won't let go
I gotta walk through what I'm in now
Goodbye clearing everything to pure white
Please stormy snow would you try oh
Cover it all just for today just forever
Oh blank it out
Please hide it all away

Oh we can't go back
To what we used to be
Even if it looks
Too sweet to be the truth
We gotta go on
To see another dawn
Even through the cold stormy snow

We used to laugh it all out
Just as always, every time
I thought you knew all of me
I thought I knew all of you
Didn't know how to read the signs
All too vague
Now I'm searching for the roots
To mistakes in my minds
If I could see you again
When we get through the cold air
Can I be true to myself
Can I just call out your name
I guess by then we'll walk it through
The Spring'll melt into the air

Too late even if I started over
Won't matter even if I wipe it all out
Paralyzed in life at the edge of a cliff
But I just gotta to keep living through what I am in now
Goodbye clearing everything to pure white
Please stormy snow would you try freezing
All my heart just for today just forever
Blank it out please hide it all away

When I wake up in the morning can I be
Someone else maybe I can
Now I know I can't I know
Just let my fantasy go
All day we live through chaos and in pain
All we do is age in time
And after all of that
Which is gonna be awaiting for us heaven or hell

I know people are always so insensitive
You'll never see the truth inside their hearts
But now I know still loving someone
And being loved back is the purpose in life
Living means we're gonna have to regret
I guess that everyone has one or two mistakes
We'll never get to redo
So anyway that is how it is
I'm just so sick of it

Too late even if I started over
Won't matter even if I wipe it all out
It'll always cling to me won't let go
I gotta walk through what I'm in now
Goodbye clearing everything to pure white
Oh please stormy snow would you try oh
Covering it all just for today just forever
Oh blank it out
Please hide it all away
