## 1 Lovesickness

Please laugh at all my tears \
See through me when I'm strong \
Forgive me when I'm spoiled \
Could you stay right here with me \
I wanna be close to you \
I don't like being cold alone \
Could you take my frozen hand \
And please hold it tight for me

I want you to understand \
All my pain and all my love for you \
My heart sighs everywhere I am \
Always low in wonder \
And everything I wanna say \
I can't get it through to you \
With a clumsy smile I try to bluff it all away

Everything you say and every move you make \
I want every piece of us in my memory \
Falling down, falling soft \
Like a snowflake in the air \
I don't want it all just melting away

Oh I don't like liars \
So I'm choosing nothing clear \
I hide how much I miss you \
Cause I'm longing for your smiles \
And everything I want to say \
I can't get it through to you \
We keep growing far apart \
And I never get it right

All the city lights sparkle like every night \
They will never be kind to you cause of that \
Shining bright, shining soft \
Like a twinkle in the sky \
All my tears were dancing through the night

If you get a little sad \
If you get a little lonely \
If you wanna cry it out \
It's all alright \
In the times you feel so sad \
In the times you feel so lonely \
You will see what's true to you \
It's all alright

If you get a little sad \
If you get a little lonely \
If you really miss him bad  \
It's all alright \
Even when you see a day pass \
Even when you're all so grown up \
Even after all the time

All the city lights sparkle like every night \
They will never be kind to you don't forget \
Shining bright, shining soft \
If you look up at the stars \
Make a wish you will see

Everything you say and every move you make \
I want every piece of us in my memory \
Falling down, falling soft \
Like a snowflake in the air \
Even if it melts away somewhere

If you get a little sad \
If you get a little lonely \
If you really miss him bad \
It's all alright \
In the love that makes you cry \
In the love that makes you lonely \
You'll treasure every peace \
Someday some time

If you get a little sad \
If you get a little lonely \
If you wanna cry it out \
It's all alright \
In the times you feel so sad \
In the times you feel so lonely \
You will see what's true to you \
It's all alright
