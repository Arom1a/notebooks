## 1 Number Bases
The most widely used numeral system is the **Hindu-Arabic numeral system**, which contains ten symbols, called *digits*: $0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9$. It is a decimal (base-10) numeral system.
There are other bases such as **binary** (base-2), **ternary** (base-3), **quaternary** (base-4), **octal** (base-8), **hexadecimal** (base-16). 

## 2 Devides
$b$ divides $a$ if $a = qb$ for some $q \in \mathbb{Z}$  Similar meaning: 
- $b$ is a divisor of $a$
- $b$ is a factor of $a$
- $a$ is a multiple of $b$

> Proposition
> Let $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}$. If $c$ divides $b$ and $b$ divides $a$, then $a$ divides $a$
> 
> First, since $c$ divides $b$, we have $b = qc$ for some $q \in \mathbb{Z}$. Analogously $a = pb$ for some $p \in \mathbb{p}$. 
> $\therefore$ $a = pb = p \cdot (qc) = (pq) \cdot c$
> $\because$ $p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$
> $\therefore$ the product is also an integer
> $\therefore$ $c$ is a factor of $a$
