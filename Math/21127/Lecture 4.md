## 1 Implication
$p \Rightarrow q$ means "if $p$, then $q$". 

## 2 Implication Rules
Introduction rule: if $q$ can be derived from the assumption that $p$ is true, then $p \Rightarrow q$ is true. 

Elimination rule: if $p \Rightarrow q$ is true and $p$ is true, then $q$ is true. 

## 3 Implication Terminology
$$p \Rightarrow q$$
if $p$, then $q$
$p$ only if $q$
$q$ if $p$
$p$ is sufficient for $q$
$q$ is necessary for $p$

## 4 Converse
The **converse** of $p \Rightarrow q$ is $q \Rightarrow p$

## 5 Biconditional
$p \Leftrightarrow q \equiv ((p \Rightarrow q) \wedge (q \Rightarrow p))$

## 6 Contradiction
$\bot$ means an arbitrary contradiction

## 7 Negation
$\neg p$ means "not $p$"

## 8 Negation Rules
Introduction rule: if a contradiction can be derived from the assumption that $p$ is true, then $\neg p$ is true. 

Elimination rule: if $\neg p$ and $p$ are both true, then a contradiction may be derived. 

## 9 Law of Exclude Middle
Let $p$ be a propositional formula. Then $p \wedge (\neg p)$ is true. 

## 10 Necessity and Sufficiency
To say a condition is "necessary" means that the result is false whenever the condition is false. 
To say a condition is "sufficient" means that the result is true whenever the condition is true.
