## 1 Propositional Formula

## 2 Conjunction
$p \wedge q$ means "$p$ and $q$"

## 3 Conjunction Rules
Introduction rule: if $p$ is true and $q$ is true, then  $p \wedge q$ is true.

Elimination rules:
- If $p \wedge q$ is true, then $p$ is true
- If $p \wedge q$ is true, then $q$ is true

## 4 Natural Deduction
Proposition $q$ follows by premises $p1, p2, p3, ...$ can be expressed as: ${p1 \, p2 \, p3 \, ...}\over{q}$

Introduction rule: $p\,q\over{p \wedge q}$

## 5 Disjunction
$p \vee q$ means "$p$ or $q$"

## 6 Disjunction Rules
Introduction rules:
- If $p$ is true, then $p \vee q$ is true
- If $q$ is true, then $p \vee q$ is true

Elimination rule: if $p \vee q$ is true, and if $r$ can be derived from p and from q, then $r$ is true.
