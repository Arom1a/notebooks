## 1 Implication of Inner Product and Norm

The inner product provides a way to measure the angle between two vectors, and the norm provides a way to measure the length of a vector. 

## 2 Theorem

Let $cal(O)$ to be an orthonomal basis of $W$. For $arrow(z) = P_(cal(O))(arrow(v)) in W$ iff $||arrow(v) - arrow(z)|| <= ||arrow(v) - arrow(w)||$. 

Implication: the projection is the place in the projection space where the vector is closest from. 

## 3 Conjugate Transpose

$A A^* dot arrow(v)$ is a projection.
