$A$ is invertible $==>$ $"det"(A) != 0$

invertible means $A = E_1 dot E_2 dot ... dot E_k$ for elementary matrices

claim: if $E$ is an elementary matrix, $"det"(A B) = "det"(A) dot "det"(B)$

a right product is column operation. E.g. $A E$ where $E$ is an elementary matrix is a column operation. 

$A E = (E^top A^top)^top$. Note that $E^top$ is also an elementary matrix

$A$ invertible iff $A^top$ invertible

> [proof]+
> suppose $A A^(-1) = I$, then $A^(-1)^top A^top = I$
