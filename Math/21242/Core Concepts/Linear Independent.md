A **list of vectors** $L$ is *linearly independent* if each vector in $"span"(L)$ has a unique representation as a [[Linear Combination]] of $L$. 

$<==>$

There doesn't exist a vector $arrow(v)_i$ in the list $L$ such that $arrow(v)_i = sum_(k = 0, k != i)^n alpha_k arrow(v)_k$. 

$<==>$

The only [[Linear Combination]] of $arrow(0)$ is $arrow(0) = sum_(i = 0)^n 0 dot arrow(v)_i$
