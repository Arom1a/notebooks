## 5 Thm: $0 arrow(v) = arrow(0)$

Uses the distributivity of vector space

$0 arrow(v) = (0 + 0) arrow(v) = 0 arrow(v) + 0 arrow(v)$

$0 arrow(v) + (-0 arrow(v)) = 0 arrow(v) + 0 arrow(v) + (-0 arrow(v))$

$arrow(0) = 0 arrow(v) + arrow(0) = 0 arrow(v)$

## 7 Thm: $c arrow(0) = arrow(0)$

Uses the distributivity of vector space

$c arrow(0) = c (arrow(0) + arrow(0)) = c arrow(0) + c arrow(0)$

$c arrow(0) + (-c arrow(0)) = c arrow(0) + c arrow(0) + (-c arrow(0))$

$arrow(0) = c arrow(0) + arrow(0) = c arrow(0)$

## 6 Thm: $-1 arrow(v) = -arrow(v)$

$arrow(v) + (-1 dot arrow(v)) = (1 + (-1)) arrow(v) = 0 arrow(v) = arrow(0)$

Thus, $-1 arrow(v)$ is indeed the additive inverse of $arrow(v)$, denoted as $-arrow(v)$. 

## 8 $arrow(v_1), arrow(v_2), ..., arrow(v_k)$ is linearly independent iff $sum^(k)_(i = 1) alpha_i arrow(v_i) = 0 => (alpha_i = 0 space forall i)$

## 9 Thm: every list of vector has a linearly independent ubslit with the same span.

## 12 Thm: $mat(dot; delim: "[")_cal(B)$ is a linear transformation

## 13 Thm: for any basis $arrow(v_1), arrow(v_2), ..., arrow(v_k)$ of $V$ and any vectors $arrow(w_1), arrow(w_2), ..., arrow(w_k)$ in $W$, there is a unique linear transformation $T : V -> W$ such that $T(arrow(v_i)) = T(arrow(w_i))$ for each $i = 1, 2, ..., k$

## 19 Definition: ![[Inverses]]

## 20 Thm: if $T$ has a left inverse and a right inverse, then any left or right inverse of $T$ is actually an inverse of $T$ and is unique

## 21 Thm: $S, T$ invertible implies $S circle.tiny T$ invertible

$f circle.tiny g$

$g^(-1) circle.tiny f^(-1)$
