## 2 Define the operation ⊕ on R+ × R+ by a ⊕ b = a · b (standard multiplication)
and ⊗ on R × R+ by a ⊗ b = ba (exponentiation). (Note that both  
operations indeed always return positive real numbers). Then V = R+  
is an R-vector space with ⊕ as the addition operation on V and ⊗ as the  
scalar multiplication. Note, R+ is the set of positive real numbers.
