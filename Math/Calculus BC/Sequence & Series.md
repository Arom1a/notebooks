### 1.1 The Squeeze Theorem for Sequence
For sequences {$a_n$}, {$b_n$}, {$s_n$} and positive integer $N$, if $a_n \le s_n \le b_n$ for every integer $n>N$, and if $\lim\limits_{x\to \infty}{a_n}=\lim\limits_{x\to \infty}{b_n}=L$, then $\lim\limits_{x\to \infty}{s_n}=L$.

### 1.2 Convergence/Divergence of a Geometric Sequence
The geometric sequence $\{s_n\}=\{r^n\}$, where r is a real number,
- converges to 0, if $-1 < r < 1$.
- converges to 1, if r=1.
- diverges for all other numbers.

### 1.3 Boundedness Theorem
A convergent sequence is bounded.

### 1.4 Test for Divergence of a Sequence
If a sequence is not bounded from above or if it is not bounded from below, then it diverges.

### 1.5 Theorem
An increasing (or nondecreasing) sequence {$s_n$} that is bounded from above converges.
A decreasing (or nonincreasing) sequence {$s_n$} that is bounded from below converges.
