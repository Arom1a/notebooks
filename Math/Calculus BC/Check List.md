## L'Hospital Rule: 
$$\lim_{x \to c}{\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}} = \lim_{x \to c}{\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}}$$
solve for $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\pm \infty}{\pm \infty}$ or $\frac{\mp \infty}{\pm \infty}$
Condition: $g'(x) \neq 0$!!!

## Discontinuity
removable, jump, infinity

## Theorems
### Intermediate Value Theorem
Conditions: continuous

### Squeeze Theorem

### Mean Value Theorem
Conditions: differentiable
![[mvt.png]]

### Extreme Value Theorem
Condition: continuous
must have both a maximum and a minimum

## Points
### Critical Point
where 1st derivative is 0 or **undefined!!!**

### Inflection Point
where 2nd derivative changes sign (ie, from - to + or from + to -)

### Concavity
![[concavity.png]]
2nd derivative > 0: concave up
2nd derivative < 0: concave down

### Absolute Extrema
List all the local extrema and compare them

### Local Extrema
#### 1st derivative test
local maximum: critical points where 1st derivative changes from + to -
local minimum: critical points where 1st derivative changes from - to +

#### 2nd derivative test
local maximum: 2nd derivative < 0
local minimum: 2nd derivative > 0
