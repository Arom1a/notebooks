## 1 Price elasticity of demand
$PED=\frac{\%\,in\,Q}{\%\,in\,P}$

Larger than 1 is elastic
Smaller than 1 is inelastic

## 2 Income elasticity
$IED=\frac{\%\,in\,Q}{\%\,in\,Income}$

Larger than 0 is normal goods
Smaller than 0 is inferior goods

## 3 Cross-price elasticity
$XED=\frac{\%\,in\,Q(of\,Good\,1)}{\%\,in\,P(of\,Good\,2)}$

Larger than 0 are substitutes
Smaller than 0 are complements
