### 1.1 How to interpret the correlation coefficient
The correlation coefficient $r$ indicates the strength of the relationship between the two variables. 
It can vary form $-1$ to $1$. If $r$ is a positive number, the variables are directly related, and if it is a negative number, the variables are inversely related. The closer the efficient comes to $\pm 1$, the stronger the relationship is.
