Conditions to check:
1. Randomness: state that the data comes from a random sample or a random experiment
2. Normality: at least 10 samples for each group (2 samples) / at least 30 samples (1 sample)
3. Independency: sample with replacement OR sample size no larger than 10% population

Z-test is the statistical test used to analyze whether two population means are different or not when the variances are known, and the sample size is large.

A T-test is a parametric test applied to identify how the average of two data sets differs when variance is not given.

There are $H_0$ which is the null hypothesis, and $H_A$ which is the alternative hypothesis. 

The null hypothesis often represents a skeptical perspective or a claim to be tested. 
The alternative hypothesis represents an alternative claim under consideration and is often represented by a range of possible parameter values. 

*Failing to reject the null hypothesis does not mean the null hypothesis is true.*

A **Type 1** error is rejecting the null hypothesis while it is actually true. 
A **Type 2** error is failing to reject the null hypothesis while the alternative is true.

Procedure:
1. State the hypotheses
2. Identify the statistical test and its procedure. Check assumptions and conditions. 
3. Compute test statistics and p-value
4. Draw conclusion, with justification. IN CONTEXT!!!
