There are $H_0$ which is the null hypothesis, and $H_A$ which is the alternative hypothesis. 

The null hypothesis often represents a skeptical perspective or a claim to be tested. 
The alternative hypothesis represents an alternative claim under consideration and is often represented by a range of possible parameter values. 

*Failing to reject the null hypothesis does not mean the null hypothesis is true.*

A **Type 1** error is rejecting the null hypothesis while it is actually true. A **Type 2** error is failing to reject the null hypothesis while the alternative is true.
