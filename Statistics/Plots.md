Ways to describe a plot: SOCS (socks rule)
1. S: Shape
2. O: Outliers
3. C: Center
4. S: Spread
## 1 Box Plots
![[boxplot.png]]
Five pieces of information are usually included in the box plots:
1. **The minimum**: shown at the far left of the plot
	The minimum is the smallest number within the range $[Q_1 - 1.5\text{IQR}, Q_3 + 1.5\text{IQR}]$. 
2. **The first quartile**, $Q_1$: shown as the far left of the box
	The first quartile, or the lower quartile, is the value under which 25% of data points are found when arranged in increasing order.
3. **The median**, $Q_2$: shown as the line in the box
4. **The third quartile**, $Q_3$: shown as the far right of the box
	The third quartile, or the upper quartile, the value under which 75% of data points are found when arranged in increasing order.
5. **The maximum**: shown as the far right of the plot
	The maximum is the largest number within the range $[Q_1 - 1.5\text{IQR}, Q_3 + 1.5\text{IQR}]$. 

Further more, there may exits outliers on the box plot. Outliers are the value outside of the range $[Q_1 - 1.5\text{IQR}, Q_3 + 1.5\text{IQR}]$.
