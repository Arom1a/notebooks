## 1 Static
The default value

## 2 Relative
Relative positioning moves the element relative to its normal (which means "static") position

## 3 Absolute
Absolute positioning removes the element from the normal document flow and positions it relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (if no ancestor is positioned, it's positioned relative to the initial containing block)

then use offset and margin to relatively position it

you can use relative to create an ancestor for the children with absolute to be positioned

## 4 Fixed
Fixed positions the element relative to the viewport
so stay fixed in place even when the page is scrolled

Stick to the top

## 5 Sticky
A hybrid between relative and fixed

First the element is positioned relatively and when it reached a set position, it becomes fixed.
