Of all the atoms on the periodic table, they all different numbers of electrons. The distribution and arrangement of these electrons were once a mystery. With development in the fields of physics and chemistry, fortunately, we can have an insight into the arrangement with the scientific theories.

Let's take the oxygen atom $\ce{O}$ as an example. Since the oxygen element has a atomic number of 8, the oxygen atom has 8 electrons. For each of the electrons, the position of it is determined by four quantum numbers: $\text{n}$, $\text{l}$,  $\text{m}_\text{l}$ , and $\text{m}_\text{s}$, which indicate the shell, the sub-shell, the orbital, and the spin respectively. We will take a look at them one by one.

## 1 Principal Quantum Number, the $\text{n}$ (the number of shell)
The principal quantum number can have positive integer numbers: $1, 2, 3, ...$ Imaging like different shells, as the $\text{n}$ becomes larger and larger, the electrons on the shell will be further from the nucleus.

## 2 Angular Momentum Quantum Number, the $\text{l}$ (the number of sub-shell)
The angular momentum quantum number can have natural numbers from $0$ to $(n-1)$ for each shell, Which means there are $n$ sub-shells in the $n$th shell.
For example, when $\text{n}=1$, $l = 0$. When $\text{n} = 2$, $\text{l} = 0,1$. And when $\text{n} = 3$, $\text{l} = 0, 1, 2$.

The name for the sub-shells are letters $s$, $p$, $d$, $f$, ... signing to 0, 1, 2, 3, ... :

| Value of $\text{l}$ | $0$ | $1$ | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ | $5$ | ... |
|:-------------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|     Letter used     | $s$ | $p$ | $d$ | $f$ | $g$ | $h$ | ... |

When we call the name of sub-shell, we say names like sub-shell $1s$, sub-shell $2s$, sub-shell $2p$, sub-shell $3d$...

## 3 Magnetic Quantum Number, the $\text{m}_\text{l}$ (the number of orbital)
For each $l$, the magnetic quantum number can have integer value between $-l$ and $l$, included, which means there are $2l+1$ of orbitals in the $l$th sub-shell.
For example, for the $4d$ sub-shell, the angular quantum number $\text{l}$ equals to $2$, so the $\text{m}_\text{l} = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2$ (5 values in total).
Here is a graph to visualize former three quantum numbers:

| $\text{n}$ | Possible Values of $\text{l}$ | Sub-shell Designation | Possible Values of $\text{m}_\text{l}$ | Number of Orbitals in Sub-shell | Total Number of Orbitals in Shell |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |

## 4 Spin Magnetic Quantum number, the $\text{m}_\text{s}$ (the electron spin)
The spin magnetic quantum number can have only 2 values, either $+\frac{1}{2}$ or $-\frac{1}{2}$. This quantum number imply that there are at most 2 electrons in the same orbital. It indicates the two opposite directions that the electrons can spin.

## 5 Conclusion
For the first shell whose $\text{n} = 1$, it has $1$ sub-shell and $1$ orbitals in total. So there are at most $1*2 = 2$ electrons in the first shell.
For the second shell whose $\text{n} = 2$, it has $2$ sub-shells and $1+3 = 4$ orbitals in total. So there are at most $4*2 = 8$ electrons in the second shell. (This is why you may heard ***the octet rule*** ——八电子稳定结构)
For the third shell whose $\text{n} = 3$, it has $3$ sub-shells and $1+3+5 = 9$ orbitals in total. So there are at most $9*2 = 18$ electrons in the third shell.
......

Let's keep our sight to the oxygen atom again. It has 8 electrons in total, so there will be 2 electrons in the first shell and 6 electrons in the second shell. However, we can not determine what orbital these electrons are in yet. In the next class, we will learn **the rule of electron configuration** by taking a look at the **Pauli exclusion principle** and **the Aufbau principle**.
