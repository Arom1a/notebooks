1. For an element, ***mass number*** is the one under the element sign (and is a fraction). 
2. ***Atomic number*** is the one on the top left  (and is ordered). 
3. The ***number of proton*** is always equal to the ***atomic number***. 
4. The ***number of neutron*** equals to the ***mass number*** subtract ***number of proton***. (This is because there are three main component of an atom: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The proton and the neutron has nearly the same mass and electrons are far lighter than protons and neutrons. Let's count the mass of one proton as one, so, the the ***mass number*** actually means the atomic mass of the atom. )
5. The ***number of electron*** equals to the ***number of proton*** subtract the ***number of charge***. (This is because the protons have positive charge and the electrons have negative charge. $\text{number of proton} - \text{number of charge} = \text{number of charge}$. And the protons are hard to lose so the ***number of proton*** is a constant for an element. )

![[Iron.png | 100]]
Take the iron as an example: 
It's mass number is 56, which is at the bottom. 
The iron has atomic number and number of neutron of 26, which is on the top. 
By $56-26 = 30$, we can know that the number of proton is equal to 30. 
$\ce{Fe}$ has 26 electrons, which is equal to the number of neutron. And $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$ has 24 electrons, since it has 2 positive charge which means it has 2 more protons than electrons.
