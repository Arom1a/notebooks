## 1 Reaction rate
### 1.1 General
$$\text{Average reaction rate}=-\frac{\Delta_{reactant}}{\Delta_{t}}$$
### 1.2 Gas reaction
$$\Delta{P}={\frac{\Delta n_{reactant}}{V}}RT=\Delta{[reactant]}RT$$
$$\text{rate}=\frac{\Delta P}{RT\Delta t}$$
### 1.3 Rate and stoichiometry
For example:
$$2H_2O_2(aq) \rightarrow 2H_2O(l)+O_2(g)$$
The rate can be expressed as:
$$\text{rate}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\Delta[H_2O_2]}{\Delta t}\text{ or }\frac{1}{2}\frac{\Delta[H_2O]}{\Delta t}\text{ or }\frac{\Delta[O_2]}{\Delta t}$$

## 2 Collision theory
Collision theory is a set of statements that gives the conditions that must be met before a chemical reacion will take place.
1. Molecular collisions
2. Activation energy
3. Collision orientation

## 3 Factors affecting reaction rates
1. Chemical and physical properties
    For example:
    * Chemical: copper and zine have different reaction rate with silver nitrate
    * Physical: the physical state or the partical size of the reactants
2. Reactant concentration
    The **greater** the concentration of a reactant causes an **increase** in the rate of the reaction.
3. Temperature
    An **increase in the temperature** increases the average kinetic energy of the reacting molecules and then results in **more collisions** to take place in a given time.
4. Catalysts and inhibitors
    * Catalysts increases the rate of reaction without changing the amount of product nor being consumed in the reaction.
    Catalysts create a **low-activation-energy pathway** which means more collisions will have sufficient energy to react.
    * Inhibitors is the opposite of catalysts.


## 4 The rate law: how concentration affects reaction rates
### 4.1 The rate law
Though experiments, scientists find that the reaction rate is directly proportional to the reactants's concentration, sometimes with exponents, that is
for
$$aA+bB=cC+dD$$
the rate law takes the form
$$\text{rate}=k[A]^{x}[B]^{y}$$
(x and y can be any real number)
### 4.2 Reaction order
$$\text{rate}=k[A]^{x}[B]^{y}$$
The overall reaction order is $(x+y)$
The reaction is xth order for A
The reaction is yth order for B

## 5 Reactant concentration and time
### 5.1 First order
$$\ln{[A]_{t}}=-kt+\ln{[A]_{0}}$$
- For gas-phase reactions:
    $$\ln{P_t}=-kt+\ln{P_0}$$
### 5.2 Second order
$$\frac{1}{[A]_t}=kt+\frac{1}{[A]_0}$$
- Pseudo-first-order reaction
    Sometimes when $[B]\gg [A]$, we can approximately say that
    $$\text{rate}=k[A][B]=k_{obs}[A]$$
    where $k_{obs}=k[B]$ and 'obs' denotes observed.
### 5.3 Zero order
$$[A]_t=-kt+[A]_0$$

## 6 Reaction half-life
Half-life is the time required for the concentration of a reactant to decrease to half of its initial concentration.
### 6.1 First order's half-life
$$\because \frac{1}{[A]_t}=-kt+\frac{1}{[A]_0}$$
**$$\therefore t_{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{1}{k}\ln{\frac{[A]_{0}}{[A]_{0}/2}}=\frac{\ln{2}}{k}$$**
### 6.2 Second order's half-life
$$\because \frac{1}{[A]_t}=kt+\frac{1}{[A]_0}$$
$$\therefore kt_{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{1}{[A]_0/2}-\frac{1}{[A]_0}$$
**$$\therefore t_{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{1}{k[A]_0}$$**
### 6.3 Zero order's half-life
$$\because [A]_t=-kt+[A]_0$$
**$$\therefore t_{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{[A]_0}{2k}$$**

## 7 Arrhenius equation
$$k=Ae^{-E_{a}/RT}$$
where $E_{a}$ is the activation energy of the reaction (in $kJ/mol$ or $J/mol$), R is the gas constant ($8.314J/K\cdot mol$), T is temperature (in $K$), A is the collision frequency called 'the frequency factor'
It can be expressed in a more useful form:
$$\ln{k}=\ln{A}-\frac{E_a}{RT}$$
$$\ln{k}=\bigg(-\frac{E_a}{R}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{1}{T}\bigg)+\ln{A}$$
Thus, a plot of $\ln{k}$ versus $\frac{1}{T}$ gives a straight line. It can be used to **calculate the activation energy** or to **find the rate constant at another temperature** if the activation energy is known.
$$\ln{\frac{k_1}{k_2}}=\frac{E_a}{R}\cdot \frac{T_1-T_2}{T_1T_2}$$
