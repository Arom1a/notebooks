## 1 Synthesis Reaction
$$\ce{A}+\ce{B}\rightarrow\ce{AB}$$
Synthesis reactions occur when two and more reactants combine to form a single product. 
E.g.: $$2\ce{Ag}+\ce{O_2}\rightarrow 2\ce{AgO}$$ $$\ce{H_2}+\ce{F_2}\rightarrow 2\ce{HF}$$

## 2 Decomposition Reaction
$$\ce{AB}\rightarrow\ce{A}+\ce{B}$$
Decomposition reactions occur when one reactant decomposes to from two or more products. 
E.g.: $$\ce{H_2CO_3}\rightarrow\ce{H_2O}+\ce{CO_2}$$

## 3 Single-displacement Reaction
$$\ce{AB}+\ce{C}\rightarrow\ce{A}+\ce{BC}$$
Single-displacement reactions often occur between a active metal and a salt solution. The active metal will dissolve into the solution and the metal in the salt will be displaced out. 
E.g.: $$\ce{Cu(OH)_2}+\ce{Na}\rightarrow 2\ce{Na(OH)}+\ce{CU}$$
The order of the activity:

最强 -- 从左到右活动性递减 -- 最弱

## 4 Double-displacement Reaction
$$\ce{AB}+\ce{CD}\rightarrow\ce{AD}+\ce{CB}$$
Double-displacement reactions often occur between two solutions and when the two solutions are mixed, either precipitate or water or gas is produced. 

The solutions are usually formed with these polyatomic ions: $\ce{CO_3^2-}$, $\ce{OH^-}$, $\ce{NO_3^2-}$, $\ce{SO_4^2-}$, $\ce{Cl^-}$, combining with other metal ions, like: $\ce{Cu^2+}$, $\ce{Ba^2+}$, $\ce{Na^+}$ , $\ce{Ag^+}$. 

Precipitate: $$\ce{Ba(OH)_2}+\ce{CuSO_4}\rightarrow\ce{BaSO_4}\downarrow+\ce{Cu(OH)_2}\downarrow$$
Gas: $$\ce{CaCO_3}+2\ce{HCl}\rightarrow\ce{CaCl_2}+\ce{CO_2}\uparrow+\ce{H_2O}$$
Water: $$\ce{NaOH}+\ce{HCl}\rightarrow\ce{NaCl}+\ce{H_2O}$$

There is a specific type of reaction in this category, the neutralization reaction: $$\ce{AOH^-}+\ce{H^+B}\rightarrow\ce{H_2O}+\ce{AB}$$ The principle of neutralization reactions is the combination of  $\ce{OH^-}$ and $\ce{H^+}$ to form $\ce{H_2O}$
