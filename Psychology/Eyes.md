## 1 Structure
Cornea: protection at the outermost layer
Pupil: where light passes through
Iris: colored muscle around the pupil, control how much light enter your eyes
Lens: accommodation changing its shape to adjust how light is refracted to the retina
Retina: the back of the eye where light is focused on
Fovea: center of the focus on retina
Optic nerve: transduction of light to electrical waves

## 2 Receptor Cells

|                    | Cones     | Rods        |
| :----------------: | :---------: | :-----------: |
|       Amount       | 6 million | 120 million |
|      location      | Center    | Periphery   |
|    dim lighting    | low       | high        |
| color sensitivity  | high      | low         |
| Detail sensitivity | high      | low         |

Sense: rods & cones -> bipolar cells -> ganglion cells

Feature Detectors

## 3 Gestalt
German word means: "whole"

Grouping mechanisms:
Proximity, Continuity, Closure
