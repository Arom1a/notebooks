Neurons are the building block of the nervous system

Neurons are made of a **cell body** (cell life support), covered with **dendrites** (receive messages), and connected with the **axon** (pass messages) that is covered with **myelin sheath** (fatty tissue) and end with terminal branches (pass massages)

The dendrite on one neuron sends out **neurotransmitters** to the axon on another neuron through the **synaptic gap**. The absorption of neurotransmitters by the axon is called **reuptake**. 

Neurotransmitters:
- endorphin: relieves pain
- serotonin: 
- dopamine: motivate people through challenges (longer period than endorphin)
- substance P: causes pain
- ACh

Agonist, Antagonist

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor

Glial cells: support cells on neurons
- Oligodengroglia (produce myelin in central nervous system)
- Schwann cells (produce myelin in peripheral nervous system)
- Astrocytes (structural)

Multiple sclerosis: myelin sheath melts down

Neuron have a threshold deciding whether it sends a impulse or not

Central nervous system (CNS) is the brain and spinal cord
Peripheral nervous system is the rest neurons around the body

Sensory (afferent) neurons carry input to the CNS
Motor (efferent) neurons carry output to the body tissues
Interneurons process info between sensory and motor neurons

PNS has 2 components:
- somatic nervous system: voluntary move (e.g.: run)
- autonomic nervous system: idle move (e.g.: beat the heart)
	- sympathetic (arousing)
	- parasympathetic (calming)

Spinal cord
reflexes: automatic response to stimuli

Endocrine system
- Hypothalamus: control pituitary gland
- Pituitary gland: secrete hormones
- Parathyroids: regulate calcium in the blood
- Thyroid gland: affects metabolism
- Adrenal glands: trigger "fight-or-flight" response (sympathetic in autonomic nervous system), release adrenaline, cortisol, and else
- Pancreas: regulate sugar in the blood
- Testis: testosterone
- Ovary: estrogen
