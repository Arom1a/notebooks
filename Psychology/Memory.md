## 1 Memory
Learning that has persisted over time

Memory could be demonstrated:
- Recall
- Recognition
- Relearning

Process to memorize:
1. Encoding: get information into brain
2. Storage: retain the information
3. Retrieval: get the information back when needed

Atkinson-Shiffrin stages:
1. Encoding
2. Rehearsal

Implicit memories: formed without one's awareness, often when Automatic processing
Procedural memory & Conditioned association are in this category

Iconic memory

To remember more: 
- Chunking
- Mnemonic
- Hierarchies
- Spacing effect - Distributed practice (massed practice - bad)
- Testing effect
- Focus on semantics
- Self-reference effect

Encoding and storage of explicit memories is related the hippocampus
Basal ganglia is involved in the formation of procedural memory
Cerebellum is involved in the formation of conditioned responses
