## 1 Brainstem
Thalamus: directs messages to sensory receiving areas in the cortex

Reticular formation: controls arousal

Pons: helps coordinate automatic and unconscious movements

Medulla: controls basic functions such as heartbeat and breathing

Cerebellum: the "little brain", processing sensory input, coordinate movement output and balance, and enabling nonverbal learning and memory

## 2 Limbic System
Amygdala: fear and anger

Hippocampus: emotionally charged memories

Hypothalamus: hunger, body temp, and emotion control. influence the pituitary gland
The reward center

EEG, MEG, PET scan, MRI, fMRI

## 3 Cerebral Cortex
association area
### 3.1 Frontal Lobes
speaking and muscle movements
Judgement, planning, and inhibition of impulses
store memories

Motor cortex

### 3.2 Parietal Lobes
touch and body position
Spatial and mathematical reasoning

Somatosensory cortex

### 3.3 Occipital Lobes
vision

### 3.4 Temporal Lobes
Auditory (opposite ear)
Recognize specific faces

## 4 Plasticity
Restore function if the brain is damaged

## 5 Lateralization
it means "going to one side"
two hemispheres have different functions

### 5.1 Left Hemisphere
Speaking
Calculating
Literal interpretations
Logic

### 5.2 Right Hemisphere
Spatial relationship
Perceptual tasks
Inferences
Facial recognition

### 5.3 Corpus callosum
Connect two brain hemispheres

## 6 Perceptual Set
