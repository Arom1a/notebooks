## 1 Learning
The process of acquiring new and relatively enduring information or behaviors

## 2 Associative Learning
We learn by association of events

### 2.1 Conditioning
the process of learning to connect the events

**Adaptation**: our sensation threshold gets higher and higher
Even if attention is called to the stimulus, cannot notice. 

**Habituation**: shift attention away from something and the stimulus will be blocked out or ignored (an attentional process)
If attention is called to the stimulus, can notice. 

Neutral stimulus: a stimulus does not trigger a response

Unconditioned stimulus: a stimulus trigger a response naturally

### 2.2 Classical Conditioning
repeated exposure, we learn the sequence of events

### 2.3 Operant Conditioning
learn to repeat events with positive results and avoid ones with bad results

## 3 Cognitive Learning
the process of learning by watching events happening around someone

## 4 Behaviorism
Pavlov, John B. Watson, B.F. Skinner

## 5 Acquisition
Initial stage of learning
get acquised: form an assiciation between NS and US
method: NS need to repeatedly appear before US

higher order conditioning: turn NS to CS by associating it to another CS

Extinction: diminishing of a CS

Spontaneous recovery: pause for a interval, the response comes back

Generalization: Response to similar stimulus

Discrimination: learn to distinguish CS to other similar stimulus

## 6 Operant conditioning

Response -> Consequence -> Response Strengthened

### 6.1 Reinforcer and Punishment

Positive reinforcement & Negative reinforcement
Positive punishment & Negative punishment

#### 6.1.1 Punishment

Severity of punishment is less useful than the instantaneousness punishment

Harm of punishment:
1. suppressed behavior, not forgotten
2. discrimination among situations
3. teaches fear
4. increase aggression

Operant chamber (Skinner box)

Aversive stimulus
Strengthened behavior

Primary reinforcer
Conditioned reinforcer

Ratio Schedule
fixed ratio
variable ratio

Interval Schedule
fixed schedule
variable schedule

## 7 Classical vs Operant

Classical: associate different stimuli do not control
response automatically
respondent behavior

Operant: 
Voluntary behavior

## 8 Preparedness

Biology legitimacy is important to develop a conditioning

## 9 Coping

alleviate stress through emotional, cognitive, or behavioral methods

- Problem-focused
- Emotion-focused

## 10 Self-control

## 11 Observational learning

called **modeling**
