Inductive reasoning
Deductive reasoning
Hypothesis: a tentative answer to a well-framed question. a testable statement
Null hypothesis: a statement asserting that there is no difference or no association between variables. 
## 1 Variables in hypotheses
Independent variables: the researcher changes or controls. 
Dependent variables: the researcher observes and measures. 
Constant variables: all variables that are kept constant in an experiment, which otherwise might affect the dependent variable. 
## 2 Collecting data
Replication
Sample size
Accuracy
Precision
Uncertainty
## 3 Theories in science
Theories: 
- Broader in scope than a hypothesis
- General, and can lead to new testable hypotheses
- Supported by a large body of evidence in comparison to a hypothesis

Models:
- Diagrams
- Three-dimensional objects
- Computer prohrams
- Mathematical equations
## 4 Control groups
Negative control group (control group): not exposed to the experimental treatment & not to any other treatment
Positive control group: not exposed to the experimental treatment & but exposed to some other treatment that is known to produce effects
