## 1 Water ($\ce{H_2O}$ molecules)

Adhesive: the attraction between water molecules.
Cohesive: the attraction between water and other molecules of different elements.

Due to adhesion force, water can climb up through thin tubes which is known as the **Capillary Action**.

## 2 Large Biological Molecules
### 2.1 Syntheses and Breakdowns of polymers
- **Condensation reaction**:
    Forming polymers. (synthesizing monomers)
    (A special case is also called **dehydration reaction** if water if formed and lost during the process. )
- **Hydrolysis**:
    Forming monomers. (breaking down polymers)
    Water is added.

### 2.2 Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are composed of $\ce{C}$, $\ce{H}$, and $\ce{O}$
Formula: $\ce{(CH_2O)_X}$
Function: fast energy, energy storage, row materials, structural materials

#### 2.2.1 Sugars
##### 2.2.1.1 **Monosaccharides**
One monomer sugars
- Glucose (6C hexose) (Glucose, Galactose, Fructose are isomers)
    $\alpha$ glucose: for energy storage purpose, used to form starch
    $\beta$ glucose: for structure purpose, used to form cellulose
- Ribose (5C pentose)
- Glyceraldehyde (3C triose)

##### 2.2.1.2 **Disaccharides**
Two monomers sugars
- Maltose
    Maltose is formed with 2 glucoses dehydration synthesizing together
- Sucrose
    Sucrose is formed with 1 glucose and 1 fructose dehydration synthesizing together
- Lactose
    %% Found in milk %%

##### 2.2.1.3 **Polysaccharides**
Large polymers
Function:
1. Energy Storage
    - Starch (plants)
        Linear polysaccharides: slow digestion
    - Glycogen (animals)
        Branched polysaccharides: fast digestion
2. Structure
    - Cellulose (plant cell wall)

### 2.3 Lipids
Lipids are composed of $\ce{C}$, $\ce{H}$, and $\ce{O}$
Function: long term energy storage, structure, endocrine
- Triglyceride (fat): glycerol + 3 fatty acids
    Functions: energy storage, cushion organs, insulates body
    1. Saturated Fats
    2. Unsaturated Fats (Healthier)
- Phospholipid: glycerol + 2 fatty acids
    Function: make cell membranes
- Steroid
    Function: sex hormones


### 2.4 Proteins
Functions: involved in almost everything - enzymes, structure, carriers & transport, cell communication, defense, movement, storage

Polymer: polypeptide
Proteins are polypeptide chains.
Monomer: amino acids
Each amino acid has a carboxyl group (COOH-), an amino group (NH2), and a R group (side chain).

Protein structures:
1. Primary Structure
    The primary sturcture is the sequence of amino acid.
    the amino acid are hold together by peptide bonds
    Amino acid sequence (determined by gene)
2. Secondary Structure
    The shape of secondary structures are due to hydrogen bonds between adjacent amino acids.
    Hydrogen bonds are the backbones of the protein.
3. Tertiary Structure
    Due to R groups (also called the side chains)
    R groups can define the amino acid and can make it behave a certain way, e.g. some are hydrophilic and some are hydrophobic.
    When the protein is folding, hydrophilic ones may hang out while hydrophobic ones may hang inside.
    The formation of the 3D shape is also because of the intermolecular forces: ionic bonds, Van der Waals interactions, disulfide bonds, and hydrogen bonds.
4. Quaternary Structure
    Proteins can be made of one or more polypeptide chains.
    The quaternary structure exists in proteins consisted of more than one polypeptide chains.
    Hydrophobic interactions between multiple polypeptide chains

If proteins are exposed into something outside its ideal environment, for example too cold or too high or too acidic or too basic, the proteins will be denatured which disrupt their shape.

### 2.5 Nucleic acids
DNA: double helix (deoxyribonucleic acid)
contains thymine and is constructed with A-T G-C.
Covalent bonds between deoxyribose backbones. 
Hydrogen bonds between nucleotides. 

RNA: single helix (ribonucleic acid)
contains uracil and is constructed with A-U G-C.
