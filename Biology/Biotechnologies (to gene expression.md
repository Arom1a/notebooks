## 1 DNA Sequencing

## 2 Gene Cloning

## 3 PCR Amplification
Polymerase Chain Reaction

1. Denaturation: make DNA separate. 
2. Annealing: primer attaches. 
3. Extension: polymerase extends the DNA. 

Each cycle, the number of DNA doubles. 

## 4 Expressing Genes

## 5 Analyzing Gene Expression

## 6 Gene Editing
Plasmids are used to insert new genes into bacteria

Cutting: 
restriction enzyme cut DNA at restriction sites
produce protruding ends â€” sticky ends

1. Find restriction sites
2. Pair sticky ends
3. Ligase glue the DNA

Recombining

Transforming
insert recombinant into bacteria

## 7 Gel electrophoresis
DNA is **negative charged**. 
DNA move from negative to positive
