helicase (the unzipping enzyme)
topoisomerase (unzip supercoil DNA)
primase (the initializer)
DNA polymerase
ligase (the gluer)




1. Helicase split the helix structure into to sperate strands
2. Of the leading strand, which is 5 to 3 direction, primase add a starting point and DNA polymerase add the following polymers
3. Of the lagging strand, the replication is done in small Okazaki fragments. The primase starts each fragment and the DNA polymerase finish the fragment. When all the work is done on the lagging strand, the ligase joins them in the end
