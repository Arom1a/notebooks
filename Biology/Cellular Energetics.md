## 1 Respiration
### 1.1 Glycolysis
1. Split sugars
2. Ancient pathway of harvesting energy
3. Inefficient
    2 ATP for every 1 glucose
4. Occurs in cytosol

$$\ce{glucose} \to \ce{2 pyruvate} + \ce{2 NADH} + \ce{2 ATP} + \ce{2 H_2O}$$

### 1.2 Pyruvate Oxidation
#### 1.2.1 Mitochondria
##### 1.2.1.1 Structure
inner membrane
outer membrane
matrix
cristae
intermembrane space

$$\ce{2 pyruvate} \to \ce{2 acetyl CoA} + \ce{2 CO_2} + \ce{2 NADH}$$

### 1.3 Kreb's Cycle
Also called critic acid cycle
In mitochondrial matrix

$$\ce{2 acetyle CoA} + \ce{2 H_2O} \to \ce{4 CO_2} + \ce{6 NADH} + \ce{2 FADH_2} + \ce{2 ATP}$$

### 1.4 Aerobic Reaction
#### 1.4.1 Electron Transport Chain
Also called oxidative phosphorylation
Take in $\ce{NADH}$, $\ce{FADH_2}$, and **$\ce{O_2}$** to produce $\ce{ATP}$ the most efficiently. 

### 1.5 Anaerobic Reaction
#### 1.5.1 Alcoholic Fermentation
$$\ce{2 pyruvate} \to \ce{2 acetaldehyde} \to \ce{ethanol}$$

eg: yeast produces the ethanol found in alcoholic drinks

#### 1.5.2 Lactic Acid Fermentation
$$\ce{2 pyruvate} \to \ce{2 lactate}$$

eg: bacteria that make yogurt carry out lactic acid fermentation, muscle carry out lactic acid fermentation when there is no enough oxygen for aerobic respiration and this is the cause of the soreness

## 2 Photosynthesis
In thylakoid

### 2.1 Light-Dependent Reaction

#### 2.1.1 Photosystem II
Light (680 nm) and $\ce{H_2O}$ in

Produce $\ce{O^2}$
Produce electrons for PS I

#### 2.1.2 Electron Transportation Chain
Electrons flows by

Produce ATP

#### 2.1.3 Photosystem I
Light (700 nm) and electron (from PS II) in

Produce NADPH for Calvin Cycle

### 2.2 Light-Independent Reaction (Calvin Cycle)
In stroma

CO2, ATP, NADPH in

Produce carbon, glucose

Carbon fixation
