## 1 Cell Membrane
Cell membrane separates living cell from aqueous environment
controls traffic in and out of the cell

## 2 Membrane Proteins
- Peripheral Proteins
    bound to surface
    Function: cell markers
- Integral Proteins
    penetrate membrane
    Function: transport proteins

## 3 Membrane Transportation
### 3.1 Active Transportation
Channel proteins
Aquaporins
Sodium-potassium pump
Electrochemical gradient

Vesicular transport
Exocytosis
Endocytosis
Pinocytosis
Receptor-mediated endocytosis

### 3.2 Passive Transportation
Osmosis
Hypertonic (high) -> Hypotonic (low)
