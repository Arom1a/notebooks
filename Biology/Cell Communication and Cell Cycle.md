## 1 Cell Membrane
Cell membrane separates living cell from aqueous environment
controls traffic in and out of the cell

## 2 Membrane Proteins
- Peripheral Proteins
    bound to surface
    Function: cell markers
- Integral Proteins
    penetrate membrane
    Function: transport proteins

## 3 Membrane Transportation
### 3.1 Active Transportation
Exocytosis, endocytosis, sodium-potassium pump

Against the concentration gradient

Primary active transport:
related to the breakdown of the ATP
(sodium-potassium pump)

Secondary:
require additional energy

Channel proteins
Aquaporins
Sodium-potassium pump
Electrochemical gradient

Vesicular transport
Exocytosis
Endocytosis
Pinocytosis
Receptor-mediated endocytosis

### 3.2 Passive Transportation
Small and non-polar to pass phosphorus bilayer
