## 1 Mitosis
Mitosis is done with PMAT: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. 
### 1.1 Prophase
Chromatin **become condensed** into chromosomes
(46 chromosomes in normal human cells, 92 chromatids after the replication, 23 in sex cells)
Centrosomes **move to the two pole** of the cell and microtubules extends from the centrosomes
mitotic spindle begins to form
Nucleolus **disappears** and the nuclear envelope **breaks down**

### 1.2 Metaphase
Chromosomes **align** at the metaphase plate at the **Middle** of the cell. 

### 1.3 Anaphase
The chromosomes is **separated** and moved **Away** from others by **the spindles**. 

### 1.4 Telophase
**Two nuclei forms**
Cell performs **cleavage** and by **cytokinesis**

## 2 Meiosis
Also called reduction division. 
Meiosis is done with two times of PMAT: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase. 
Sperms and egg cells are called gametes or sex cells. They have 23 chromosomes each. 
### 2.1 Meiosis 1
#### 2.1.1 Prophase 1
1.  Homologous pairs (synopsis)
2. Crossing over
(the 23rd pair of chromosomes does not cross over since they are sex chromosomes: XX = Female, XY = Male)

#### 2.1.2 Metaphase 1
Same

#### 2.1.3 Anaphase 1
Same

#### 2.1.4 Telophase 1
Same, haploid cells form

### 2.2 Meiosis 2
#### 2.2.1 Prophase 2
Same but no crossing over

#### 2.2.2 Metaphase 2
Same

#### 2.2.3 Anaphase 2
Same

#### 2.2.4 Telophase 2
Same
