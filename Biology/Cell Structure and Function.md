## 1 Introduction
The cells are the basic structural and functional units of every organism
There are 2 types of cells:
1. Prokaryotic cells
	Domain bacteria
	Domain archaea
2. Eukaryotic cells
	Domain eukarya
	Protists, fungi, animals, plants

All cells share common features:
plasma membrane, cytoplasm, chromosome - DNA, ribosome

### 2.1 Shared Organelles
#### 2.1.1 Plasma Membrane
Also called the cell membrane.
Protect organells inside the cell.

#### 2.1.2 Nucleus
Nucleus contains DNA material.
Chromatin is found inside the nuclear membrane.
Nucleus also contains a nucleolus, where ribosomes are made.

#### 2.1.3 Cytoplasm
Everything inside the cell is floating around in cytoplasm, which is the jelly-like substance.

#### 2.1.4 Ribosomes
Ribosomes are the protein factories.
Originated in the nucleolus, they get out
wonder freely inside the cytoplasm or attach to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
synthesize protein according to mRNA sequence

#### 2.1.5 Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
There are rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the rough one has ribosomes attach to it and the smooth one doesn't have.
The ER is a membrane for transporting materials, such as the proteins synthesized by ribosomes.
Proteins and other materials emerge in small **vesicles**.

#### 2.1.6 Golgi apparatus
Golgi apparatus is the protein processing plant.
Proteins are customized into forms that the cell can use.
It's where proteins are folded into usable shapes or adding other materials onto them, such as lipids and carbohydrates.

#### 2.1.7 Mitochondrion
Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell.
They make ATP that provide the energy for all cell activities through cellular respiration.
More details in chapter [[Cellular Energetics]].
Cell that needs more energy has more mitochondria.

#### 2.1.8 Cytoskeleton
The cytoskeleton is the structure.
Cytoskeleton includes thread-like microfilaments (which are made of protein), and thin hollow tubes microtubules.

#### 2.1.9 Peroxisome
Toxic substances can be broken down by peroxisomes. Peroxisomes play the role of detoxing. 

### 2.2 Organelles of animal cells
#### 2.2.1 Lysosome
Lysosomes are the garbage collectors.
They are filled with enzymes that break down cellular debris.

#### 2.2.2 Centrosome
The centrosome is made up of two perpendicular centrioles, a daughter centriole, and a mother centriole, linked together by interconnecting fibres.
Its main function is to organize the microtubules and provide a structure to the cell.
It also pulls the chromatids apart during cell division.

#### 2.2.3 Microvilli
Microvilli are mostly found in small intestine, on the surface of egg cells, and on white blood cells. It expands the surface area of the cell and making them able to absorb more nutrient. 

### 2.3 Organelles of plant cells
#### 2.3.1 Vacuoles
A sac-like structures that store different materials.
Stores water in plant cells.

#### 2.3.2 Chloroplast
The chloroplast is where photosynthesis happens.
It contains green pigments called chlorophyll.
More details in chapter [[Cellular Energetics]].

#### 2.3.3 Cell wall
Plant cells also have a cell wall outside of their cell membranes that shape, support, and protect the plant cell.
Animal cells never have a cell wall.

#### 2.3.4 Plasmodesmata
Plasmodesmata are small channels that directly connect cytoplasm of neighboring plant cells for cellular communications between plant cells.
