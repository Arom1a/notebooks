## 1 Transcription
Happens in nucleus
1. the replicated gene will begin with a **promoter region** and end with a **terminator region**.
    The RNA polymerase will bind to the promoter region
    It will apply complimentary base pair up the gene from 5 prime to 3 prime direction
2. the transcribed pre-mRNA will have **exons** and **introns**. The non-coding introns will be removed and a 5 prime cap and 3 prime poly-A-tail will be added. This is called the intron splicing and is done by spliceosome to create a mature mRNA
3. The mature mRNA will then leave the nucleus and enter the cytoplasm for translation.

## 2 Translation
Happens in cytoplasm
1. 3 adjacent of the nitrogen bases on the mRNA are grouped into 3-letter codes which are called codons. The codons will code for specific amino acids to build the proteins
    There are 4 special codons: AUG is the start codon; UGA, UAG, UAA are stop codons.
2. **Small ribosomal subunit** will bind to the start codon. Amino acid is brought by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule. After this initialization, the **large ribosomal subunit** will bind to the small one to form the **translation complex**. The complex will have E, P, and A sites. A charged tRNA comes to A site and a peptide bond forms between the amino acids to construct the polypeptide. 
3. in the end, when the complex reach the stop codon, a **release factor** binds to A site and the polypeptide is released.
