## 1 Natural selection
conditions should satisfy:
- have over-population
- heritable variation
- competition (for food, mates, nesting sites, escape predators)
- advantage traits and adaptation
- descent with modification

Microevolution and Macroevolution

## 2 Artificial Selection
Traits are human determined/desired

## 3 Evidences
1. Fossil evidence
2. Biogeography evidence
3. Biological molecular evidence
4. Anatomy evidence
    Homologous structures provide evidence for common ancestry
    Analogous structures show that similar selective pressures can produce similar adaptations
5. Biochemical / Metabolic evidence

Analogous structures: share a similar function
Homologous structures: share a similar embryonic structure
Vestigial structures: have most of their original function
Convergent structures: share similar function but can not be attributed to a common ancestor

## 4 Mechanisms of Evolution
Mutation
Migration
Sexual repoduction (during meiosis)
Natural selection
Genetic drift
    - Bottleneck effect
    - Founder effect
Gene flow
Nonrandom mating
Natural selection1

## 5 Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
A mathematical model to estimate genotype frequency of a population that is in genetic equillibrium

Dominant homozygote: $p^2$
Heterozygote: $2pq$
Recessive homozygote: $q^2$

Conditions:
- No mutation
- No migration
- Large population size
- Random mating
- No selection

## 6 Speciation
![[speciation.png]]
### 6.1 Allopatric
allo- means other

Speciate due to **geographical isolation**

### 6.2 Peripatric
peir- means near

Speciate due to an **isolated population**

### 6.3 Parapatric
para- means beside

Speciate due to a **continuous-distributed population**

### 6.4 Sympatric
sym- means same

Speciate due to **reproductive isolation**:
#### 6.4.1 Prezygotic
- Habitate / Ecological isolation
- Terporal isolation
- Behavioral isolation
- Gametic isolation
- Mechanical isolation

#### 6.4.2 Postzygotic
Unable to reproduce, mostly due to hybrid
