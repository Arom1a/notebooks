## 1 Natural selection
conditions should satisfy:
- have over-population
- heritable variation
- competition (for food, mates, nesting sites, escape predators)
- advantage traits and adaptation
- descent with modification

Microevolution and Macroevolution

## 2 Artificial Selection
Traits are human determined/desired

## 3 Evidences
1. Fossil evidence
2. Biogeography evidence
3. Biological molecular evidence
4. Anatomy evidence
    Homologous structures provide evidence for common ancestry
    Analogous structures show that similar selective pressures can produce similar adaptations
5. Biochemical / Metabolic evidence

Homologous structures: share a similar embryonic structure and share a common ancestor but have completely different functions (due to divergent evolution)
Analogous structures: share a similar function but not necessarily in structure and do not derive from a common ancestral feature (due to convergent evolution)
Vestigial structures: have lost most of their original function

## 4 Mechanisms of Evolution
Mutation
Migration
Sexual repoduction (during meiosis)
Natural selection
Genetic drift
    - Bottleneck effect: a sharp reduction in the size of a population due to environmental events
    - Founder effect: occurs when a new population is established by a very small number of individuals from a larger population
Gene flow
Nonrandom mating
Natural selection

## 5 Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
A mathematical model to estimate genotype frequency of a population that is in genetic equillibrium

Dominant homozygote: $p^2$
Heterozygote: $2pq$
Recessive homozygote: $q^2$

Conditions:
- No mutation
- No migration
- Large population size
- Random mating
- No selection

## 6 Speciation
![[speciation.png]]
### 6.1 Allopatric
allo- means other

Speciate due to **geographical isolation**

### 6.2 Peripatric
peir- means near

Speciate due to an **isolated population**

### 6.3 Parapatric
para- means beside

Speciate due to a **continuous-distributed population**

### 6.4 Sympatric
sym- means same

Speciate due to **reproductive isolation**

#### 6.4.1 Prezygotic
- Habitate / Ecological isolation
- Terporal isolation
- Behavioral isolation
- Gametic isolation
- Mechanical isolation

#### 6.4.2 Postzygotic
Unable to reproduce, mostly due to hybrid
