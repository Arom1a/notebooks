## 1 Natural selection
- have over-population
- heritable variation
- competition (for food, mates, nesting sites, escape predators)
- advantage traits and adaptation
- descent with modification

## 2 Artificial Selection
Traits are human determined/desired

## 3 Evidences
1. Biogeography
2. Biological molecular
3. Biochemical / Metabolic

Analogous structures: share a similar function
Homologous structures: share a similar embryonic structure
Vestigial structures: have most of their original function
Convergent structures: share similar function but can not be attributed to a common ancestor

## 4 Population Evolution


## 5 Mechanisms of Evolution
Mutation
Sexual repoduction (during meiosis)
Natural selection
Genetic drift
    - Bottleneck effect
    - Founder effect
Gene flow

## 6 Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
Dominant homozygote: $p^2$
Heterozygote: $2pq$
Recessive homozygote: $q^2$

## 7 Reproduction Barriers
### 7.1 Pre-reproduction barriers
- Habitat isolation / Ecological isolation
- Temporal isolation
- Behavioral isolation
- Mechanical isolation
- Gametic isolation

### 7.2 Post-reproduction barriers
- Reduced hybrid viability
