## 1 Natural selection
conditions should satisfy:
- have over-population
- heritable variation
- competition (for food, mates, nesting sites, escape predators)
- advantage traits and adaptation
- descent with modification

## 2 Artificial Selection
Traits are human determined/desired

## 3 Evidences
1. Biogeography
2. Biological molecular
3. Biochemical / Metabolic

Analogous structures: share a similar function
Homologous structures: share a similar embryonic structure
Vestigial structures: have most of their original function
Convergent structures: share similar function but can not be attributed to a common ancestor

## 4 Mechanisms of Evolution
Mutation
Sexual repoduction (during meiosis)
Natural selection
Genetic drift
    - Bottleneck effect
    - Founder effect
Gene flow

## 5 Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
Dominant homozygote: $p^2$
Heterozygote: $2pq$
Recessive homozygote: $q^2$

## 6 Speciation
![[speciation.png]]
### 6.1 Allopatric
allo- means other

Speciate due to **geographical isolation**

### 6.2 Peripatric
peir- means near

Speciate due to an **isolated population**

### 6.3 Parapatric
para- means beside

Speciate due to a **continuous-distributed population**

### 6.4 Sympatric
sym- means same

Speciate due to **reproductive isolation**:
#### 6.4.1 Prezygotic
- Habitate / Ecological isolation
- Terporal isolation
- Behavioral isolation
- Gametic isolation
- Mechanical isolation

#### 6.4.2 Postzygotic
Unable to reproduce, mostly due to hybrid
