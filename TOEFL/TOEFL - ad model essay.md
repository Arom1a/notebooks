I agree with the second student's opinion. I believe that the best solution is to reduce the number of government employees. A great way to achieve this goal might be developing Apps or websites to replace their jobs. 

First, this is because such a move will actually improve government service standards, rather than the opposite. When everything is available online, at the touch of a button, life is actually more convenient, since people won't have to drive to a government office and wait in a long line just to hand in some paperwork, and they don't have to worry about weekends or bank holidays. These appa have already been in use in cities like Shanghai, and has sped up processes like registering in local primaries schools, cutting time needed from 8hours at a government office, to 5 minutes on the App. 

Secondly, this can lead to significant savings. Government emplyees are usually well compensated for the functions they perform, often receiving paychecks of over a million RMB a year. Therefore, if a few of them can be laid off, millions of RMB can be saved. y comparison, how much money can you save from not maintaining or watering the trees in the parks?

Considering the fact that the modern world is built on shared scientific discoveries, I wholeheartedly support the idea that scientific breakthroughs should be shared. 

First, sharing leads to financial benefits. Individuals or companies making the discovery have the opportunity to commercialize their ideas by transforming them into products. this potential financial return may serve as a powerful incentive for researchers to pursue further discoveries. Example of this type abound. Almost all the products used in daily life feature successful commercialization of ideas and patents, from smart phones and computers to cruise ships and airplanes. Would there be as many patents filed annually if inventors were instructed to hold their findings secret? I doubt it. 

Secondly, sharing facilitates peer review. The publication of discoveries allows fellow scientist, as well as lay persons, to attempt to replicate the findings and provide feedback to the origina dis coverer. Such review is crucial for science and technology since it further validates what is true and identifies cases where the new theory might falter. No theory is perfect upon birth, and peer review is what it takes to be there.
